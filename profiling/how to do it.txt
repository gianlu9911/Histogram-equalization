- first of all do:
     cd so that you go in /home/sangi/my_programs/parallel_computing/hitogram_equalization

- now:
     ncu -o ./profiling/histogram_cuda_profile build/CudaVariation
    
    this should create a profiling file inside the profiling folder.

- now:
    ncu-ui ./profiling/histogram_cuda_profile.ncu-rep

    this should open a gui making readable the file

    REMEMBER: when the gui opens, make sure to check all the suggest! 
    you can do it opening the box called Pages!
